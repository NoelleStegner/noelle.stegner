        <h4>Communication Design</h4>

        <h4>Degree: B.F.A. </h4>


        <p>The BFA degree, building on the solid foundation in visual expression
          of the first two years, develops students'' abilities to frame, research
          and solve increasingly complex visual communication problems. Students
          develop a professional portfolio that represents their talents and
          prepares them for employment upon graduation as art directors, graphic
          designers, illustrators and web designers. They are also qualified to
           apply for masters programs in related communication design fields. In
           recent years, graduates of the program have been employed by a range
           of creative agencies, design firms and organizations including BBDO,
           J. Walter Thompson Worldwide, Ogilvy, DDB, Google, Patients & Purpose,
            GLOW Digital agency, Victoriaâ€™s Secret, The Vyater Group, Mass Appeal
             Records, Ralph Lauren Advertising, The New York Times, New York Code
             + Design Academy, AT&T Entertainment Group - DIRECTV, JP Morgan Chase,
             New York Life Insurance Company and UNICEF USA.</p>

          <p>Students take courses from three categories: Studio, Strategy,
            and Skills. In the required sequence of four Studio courses, students
            initiate and define the context for substantive projects.
             Selecting from an elective pool, each student takes three
             Strategy courses and four Skills courses. In Strategy courses,
              students research, plan, produce and consider dissemination of visual
              communications. In Skills courses, students create solutions to
              communication design problems using a particular medium.
               Students may either sample a range of the Communication Design
               field or specialize in one of the following areas: Advertising,
               Graphic Design, Illustration or Web Design.</p>
